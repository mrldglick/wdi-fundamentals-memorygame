	<h3>A game for drunks, children, and gamblers.</h3>
		
		<p> 
		Outside the wagering of cash, this game has little to offer anyone over the age of 8 who has not consumed some form of illicit substance prior to starting. However, should one be determined to play, one is recomended first to place on a blindfold, take off all other clothing, and then attempt to carry ones laptop into the middle of the road, before proceeding with the game.
